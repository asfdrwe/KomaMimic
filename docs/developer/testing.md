# Automated tests

Qt Test and Python 3.9+ are required. The Windows SDK setup helper needs Python
3.10+. The examples below are for Linux/macOS. Keep test builds separate from the
application-only builds in the README.

```sh
python3 tools/check_source.py
cmake -S . -B build-test -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DKOMAMIMIC_TEST_SCOPE=full
cmake --build build-test --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build-test --output-on-failure --parallel 2 --no-tests=error
```

On Windows, prepare the README environment and use a separate build:

```powershell
cmake --preset windows-fast -B build-windows-test -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build-windows-test --config Release --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build-windows-test -C Release --output-on-failure --parallel 2 --no-tests=error
```

Set PATH for the Qt and vcpkg DLLs and configure Qt plugin discovery as in the build
instructions.

## Test scopes

`full` contains 17 groups: reader, UI, feature, format, PDF, CLI, script, PIC,
document, power, evolution, cache, i18n, archive_text, legacy_settings, plus format
checks under the C locale and Python distribution checks.

`platform` contains nine groups: CLI, UI, PDF, script, document, power, cache, i18n,
and distribution. Some Qt groups run only the functions needed for OS integration.
This is the Windows-fast default. Its cache group is limited to the regression
that verifies process exit at 48 cancellation points during ZIP reading and image
extraction. Do not report nine passing platform groups as 17 passing full groups.

```sh
ctest --test-dir build-test -R '^(ui|script)_tests$' --output-on-failure
```

## Execution conditions and interpreting results

CTest runs Qt tests offscreen with temporary settings and original synthetic inputs.
If real WebEngine, local IPC, or D-Bus is unavailable, tests may skip with a reason.
Record CTest successes, Qt pass/fail/skip counts, and Python test counts separately.
A Qt skip does not complete a GUI check. The dedicated Linux D-Bus test requires
`dbus-daemon`.

`distribution_tests` checks public source re-export, rejection of unclassified data,
reproducible source archives, synthetic fixture loading and RGBA comparisons, and
validation/deployment helpers. Git tracking tests create small repositories only
inside temporary directories; they do not initialize the active public source tree.

## Validation with logs

```sh
python3 tools/prepare_validation.py --output validation-kit
python3 tools/prepare_validation.py --verify validation-kit
python3 tools/run_validation.py run --build-dir build-test \
  --fixtures validation-kit/fixtures --output results/run-01 \
  --jobs 4 --test-scope full
```

Use a new output name for each run. Keep result JSON, CTest logs, dependency versions,
and source hashes; do not mix them with old failure logs or successes from another
build. Native manual checks have a [separate procedure](platform-validation.md).
